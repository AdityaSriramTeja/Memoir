- Use Convex Hulls (in Geopandas intro guide) / Merge Polygons in PyGIS to compute cities, states, and countries (groups)
- Potential: Use buffers to compute intersecting points (close points)
- Customize on which zoom levels should each of the elements be displayed
- All rendering should be done in Leaflet.js (frontend), backend is only responsible for generating GeoJSON (with all the recursively compiled metadata like topics and subtopics)
- Color differently

- To deal with multiple parents:- Write algo to find closest common parent
- Afterwards, think about Icons

- Hover highlights all polygons of the same group
- Label on blobs (maybe only start labelling after a certain zoom level)
- Refresh on `npm run dev`
- Urls to points
- Search bar

- Dynamic text size based on zoom level
- Deal with multiple parent layers (nested, grandparent, etc)
- Consolidate websites/source from chunks
