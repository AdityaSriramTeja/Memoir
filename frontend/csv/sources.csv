argument and thought-experiment now generally known as the Chinese Room Argument was first published in a 1980 article by American philosopher John Searle (1932 ). It has become one of the best-known arguments in recent philosophy. Searle imagines himself alone in a room following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters slipped under the door. Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals just as a computer does, he sends appropriate strings of Chinese characters back out under the door, and this leads those outside to mistakenly suppose there is a Chinese speaker in the room.

the Turing Test is inadequate. Searle argues that the thought experiment underscores the fact that computers merely use syntactic rules to manipulate symbol strings, but have no understanding of meaning or semantics. The broader conclusion of the argument is that the theory that human minds are computer-like computational or information processing systems is refuted. Instead minds must result from biological processes; computers can at best simulate these biological processes.

Overview Work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has produced computer programs that can beat the world chess champion, control autonomous vehicles, and defeat the best human players on the television quiz show Jeopardy. By 2022 AI had evolved from personal digital assistants (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant) translating and answering questions to using Large Language Models (LLMs) that could write poems, college level essays, and computer programs, and could pass exams designed to screen the entrants into graduate schools, the study and practice of Law, and other learned professions .

computer prowess at conversation, writing essays, and passing difficult examinations then show that computers can understand language and be intelligent Will further development result in digital computers that fully match or even exceed human intelligence  Alan Turing (1950), one of the pioneer theoreticians of computing, believed the answer to these questions was yes . Turing proposed what is now known as The Turing Test : if a computer can pass for human in online chat, we should grant that it is intelligent. By the late 1970s some AI researchers claimed that computers already understood at least some natural language. In 1980 U. C. Berkeley philosopher John Searle introduced a short and widely-discussed argument intended to show conclusively that it is impossible for digital computers to understand language or think, now or in the future Searle argues that a good way to test a theory of mind, say a theory that holds that understanding can be created by doing such and such, is to imagine what it would be like to actually do what the theory says will create understanding. Searle (1999) summarized his Chinese Room Argument (hereinafter, CRA) concisely: Imagine a native English speaker who knows no Chinese locked in a room full of boxes of Chinese symbols (a data base) together with a book of instructions for manipulating the symbols (the program)."

that people outside the room send in other Chinese symbols which, unknown to the person in the room, are questions in Chinese (the input). And imagine that by following the instructions in the program the man in the room is able to pass out Chinese symbols which are correct answers to the questions (the output). The program enables the person in the room to pass the Turing Test for understanding Chinese but he does not understand a word of Chinese. Searle goes on to say, The point of the argument is this: if the man in the room does not understand Chinese on the basis of implementing the appropriate program for understanding Chinese then neither does any other digital computer solely on that basis because no computer, qua computer, has anything the man does not have. Thirty years after introducing the CRA Searle 2010 describes the conclusion in terms of consciousness and intentionality: I demonstrated years ago with the so-called Chinese Room Argument that the implementation of the computer program is not by itself sufficient for consciousness or intentionality (Searle 1980)."

is defined purely formally or syntactically, whereas minds have actual mental or semantic contents, and we cannot get from syntactical to the semantic just by having the syntactical operations and nothing else. To put this point slightly more technically, the notion same implemented program defines an equivalence class that is specified independently of any specific physical realization. But such a specification necessarily leaves out the biologically specific powers of the brain to cause cognitive processes. A system, me, for example, would not acquire an understanding of Chinese just by going through the steps of a computer program that simulated the behavior of a Chinese speaker (p.17).

a desire for a piece of chocolate as well as thoughts about real-world Manhattan or fictional Harry Potter all display intentionality, as will be discussed in more detail in section 5.2 below. Searle s shift from machine understanding to consciousness and intentionality is not directly supported by the original 1980 argument. However the re-description of the conclusion indicates the close connection between understanding and consciousness in Searle s later accounts of meaning and intentionality. Those who don t accept Searle s linking of understanding and consciousness might hold that running a program can create understanding without necessarily creating consciousness, and conversely a fancy robot might have dog level consciousness, desires, and beliefs, without necessarily understanding natural language.

aims to refute the functionalist approach to understanding minds, that is, the approach that holds that mental states are defined by their causal roles, not by the stuff (neurons, transistors) that plays those roles. The argument counts especially against that form of functionalism known as the Computational Theory of Mind that treats minds as information processing systems. As a result of its scope, as well as Searle s clear and forceful writing style, the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear since the Turing Test. By 1991 computer scientist Pat Hayes had defined Cognitive Science as the ongoing research project of refuting Searle s argument.

Background 2.1 Leibniz Mill Searle s argument has four important antecedents. The first of these is an argument set out by the philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646 1716). This argument, often known as Leibniz Mill , appears as section 17 of Leibniz Monadology.

Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which depends upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to say, by means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a machine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill.

Latta translation] Notice that Leibniz s strategy here is to contrast the overt behavior of the machine, which might appear to be the product of conscious thought, with the way the machine operates internally. He points out that these internal mechanical operations are just parts moving from point to point, hence there is nothing that is conscious or that can explain thinking, feeling or perceiving. For Leibniz physical states are not sufficient for, nor constitutive of, mental states. To this day the mystery of consciousness remains; one can still follow Leibniz suggestion and imagine a brain made so huge that one could walk between the neurons, and all one would see is, at best, squirts of neurotransmitters, and nothing to explain conscious experience, including the experience of understanding language. Leibniz argument, that no matter what a physical system does, there would be no consciousness (and so materialism is refuted), is parallel to Searle s claim that no matter what syntactic processing there is, there would be no understanding of meaning (and so strong AI claims are refuted)."

Turing s Paper Machine A second antecedent to the Chinese Room argument is the idea of a paper machine, a computer implemented by a human. This idea is found in the work of Alan Turing, for example in Intelligent Machinery (1948). Turing writes there that he wrote a program for a paper machine to play chess. A paper machine is a kind of program, a series of simple steps like a computer program, but written in natural language (e.g., English), and implemented by a human.

the operator does is follow the instructions for generating moves on the chess board. In fact, the operator need not even know that he or she is involved in playing chess  the input and output strings, such as N QB7 need mean nothing to the operator of the paper machine. As part of the WWII project to decipher German military encryption, Turing had written English-language programs for human computers , as these specialized workers were then known, and these human computers did not need to know what the programs that they implemented were doing. One reason the idea of a human-plus-paper machine is important is that it already raises questions about agency and understanding similar to those in the CRA.

thereby implement a paper machine that generates symbol strings such as N-KB3 that I write on pieces of paper and slip under the door to someone ouside the room. Suppose further that prior to going into the room I don t know how to play chess, or even that there is such a game. However, unbeknownst to me, in the room I am running Turing s chess program and the symbol strings I generate are chess notation and are taken as chess moves by those outside the room. They reply by sliding the symbols for their own moves back under the door into the room.

Crane discusses the Chinese Room argument in his 1991 book, The Mechanical Mind. He cites the Churchlands 1990 luminous room analogy, but then goes on to argue that in the course of operating the room, Searle would learn the meaning of the Chinese:  if Searle had not just memorized the rules and the data, but also started acting in the world of Chinese people, then it is plausible that he would before too long come to realize what these symbols mean. (127).

I now know how to play chess Or is it the system (consisting of me, the manuals, and the paper on which I manipulate strings of symbols) that is playing chess If I memorize the program and do the symbol manipulations inside my head, do I then know how to play chess, albeit with an odd phenomenology Do someone s conscious states matter for whether or not they know how to play chess If a digital computer implements the same program, does the computer (or program or computer plus program) then play chess, or merely simulate this  By mid-century Turing was optimistic that the newly developed electronic computers themselves would soon be able to exhibit apparently intelligent behavior, answering questions posed in English and carrying on conversations. Turing (1950) proposed what is now known as the Turing Test: if a computer could pass for human in on-line chat, it should be counted as intelligent. A third antecedent of Searle s argument was the work of Searle s colleague at Berkeley, Hubert Dreyfus. Dreyfus was an early critic of the optimistic claims made by AI researchers.

argued that key features of human mental life could not be captured by formal rules for manipulating symbols. Dreyfus moved to Berkeley in 1968 and in 1972 published his extended critique, What Computers Can t Do . Dreyfus primary research interests were in Continental philosophy, with its focus on consciousness, intentionality, and the role of intuition and the inarticulated background in shaping our understandings. Dreyfus identified several problematic assumptions in AI, including the view that brains are like digital computers, and, again, the assumption that understanding can be codified as explicit rules.

work of one of these, Yale researcher Roger Schank (Schank  Abelson 1977) came to Searle s attention. Schank s team developed a technique called conceptual representation that used scripts to represent conceptual relations (related to Conceptual Role Semantics). Searle s argument was originally presented in 1980 specifically as a response to the claim that AI programs such as Schank s literally understand the sentences that they respond to. 2.3 The Chinese Nation A fourth antecedent to the Chinese Room argument are thought experiments involving myriad humans acting as a computer.

4 hours each student repeatedly does a bit of calculation on binary numbers received from someone near them, then passes the binary result onto someone nearby. They learn the next day that they collectively translated a sentence from Portuguese into their native Russian. Mickevich s protagonist concludes We ve proven that even the most perfect simulation of machine thinking is not the thinking process itself, which is a higher form of motion of living matter. Apparently independently, a similar consideration emerged in early discussion of functionalist theories of minds and cognition (see further discussion in section 5.3 below), Functionalists hold that mental states are defined by the causal role they play in a system (just as being a door stop is defined by what it does, not by what it is made out of). Critics of functionalism were quick to turn its proclaimed virtue of multiple realizability against it."

emphasizing causal or information processing roles as the essence of mental states, functionalism allowed us to understand creatures with different physiology, for example extraterrestrials, to have the same types of mental states as humans  pains, for example. But it was pointed out that if extraterrestrial aliens, with some other complex system in place of brains, could realize the functional properties that constituted mental states, then, presumably so could systems even less like human brains. The computational form of functionalism, which holds that the defining role of each mental state is its role in information processing or computation, is particularly vulnerable to this maneuver, since a wide variety of systems with simple components are computationally equivalent (see e.g., Maudlin 1989 for discussion of a computer built from buckets of water). Critics asked if it was really plausible that these inorganic systems could have mental states or feel pain.

summarizes Davis thought experiment as follows: Let a functionalist theory of pain (whatever its details) be instantiated by a system the subassemblies of which are not such things as C-fibers and reticular systems but telephone lines and offices staffed by people. Perhaps it is a giant robot controlled by an army of human beings that inhabit it. When the theory s functionally characterized conditions for pain are now met we must say, if the theory is true, that the robot is in pain. That is, real pain, as real as our own, would exist in virtue of the perhaps disinterested and businesslike activities of these bureaucratic teams, executing their proper functions.

scenario has subsequently been called The Chinese Nation or The Chinese Gym . We can suppose that every Chinese citizen would be given a call-list of phone numbers, and at a preset time on implementation day, designated input citizens would initiate the process by calling those on their call-list. When any citizen s phone rang, he or she would then phone those on his or her list, who would in turn contact yet others. No phone message need be exchanged; all that is required is the pattern of calling.

phone calls play the same functional role as neurons causing one another to fire. Block was primarily interested in qualia, and in particular, whether it is plausible to hold that the population of China might collectively be in pain, while no individual member of the population experienced any pain, but the thought experiment applies to any mental states and operations, including understanding language. Thus Block s thought experiment, as with those of Davis and Dennett, is a system of many humans rather than one. The focus is on consciousness, but to the extent that Searle s argument also involves consciousness, the thought experiment is closely related to Searle s. Cole (1984) tries to pump intuitions in the reverse direction by setting out a thought experiment in which each of his neurons is itself conscious, and fully aware of its actions including being doused with neurotransmitters, undergoing action potentials, and squirting neurotransmitters at its neighbors.

addition, Searle s article in BBS was published along with comments and criticisms by 27 cognitive science researchers. These 27 comments were followed by Searle s replies to his critics. In the decades following its publication, the Chinese Room argument was the subject of very many discussions.

included the Chinese Room Argument in his contribution, Is the Brain s Mind a Computer Program , and Searle s piece was followed by a responding article, Could a Machine Think , written by philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. Soon thereafter Searle had a published exchange about the Chinese Room with another leading philosopher, Jerry Fodor (in Rosenthal (ed.)1991). The heart of the argument is Searle imagining himself following a symbol-processing program written in English (which is what Turing called a paper machine ).

human produces the appearance of understanding Chinese by following the symbol manipulating instructions, but does not thereby come to understand Chinese. Since a computer just does what the human does  manipulate symbols on the basis of their syntax alone  no computer, merely by following a program, comes to genuinely understand Chinese. This narrow argument, based closely on the Chinese Room scenario, is specifically directed at a position Searle calls Strong AI . Strong AI is the view that suitably programmed computers (or the programs themselves) can understand natural language and actually have other mental capabilities similar to the humans whose behavior they mimic.

contrast, weak AI is the much more modest claim that computers are merely useful in psychology, linguistics, and other areas, in part because they can simulate mental abilities. But weak AI makes no claim that computers actually understand or are intelligent. The Chinese Room argument is not directed at weak AI, nor does it purport to show that no machine can think  Searle says that brains are machines, and brains think.

L be a natural language, and let us say that a program for L is a program for conversing fluently in L. A computing system is any system, human or otherwise, that can run a program.

second premise is supported by the Chinese Room thought experiment. The conclusion of this narrow argument is that running a program cannot endow the system with language understanding. (There are other ways of understanding the structure of the argument. It may be relevant to understand some of the claims as counterfactual: e.g. there is a program in premise 1 as meaning there could be a program, etc. On this construal the argument involves modal logic, the logic of possibility and necessity (see Damper 2006 for the CRA reconstructed as a modal 5 step reductio and Shaffer 2009 in response))."

is also worth noting that the claim made by Strong AI in the first premise above attributes understanding to the system . Exactly what Strong-AI supposes will acquire understanding when the program runs is crucial to the success or failure of the CRA. Schank 1978 has a title that claims their group s computer, a physical device, understands, but in the body of the paper he claims that the program [ SAM ] is doing the understanding: SAM, Schank says ...understands stories about domains about which it has knowledge (p. 133). As we will see in the next section (4), these issues about the identity of the understander (the cpu the program the system something else ) quickly came to the fore for critics of the CRA.

larger claim and related issues are discussed in section 5: The Larger Philosophical Issues. 4. Replies to the Chinese Room Argument Criticisms of the narrow Chinese Room argument against Strong AI have often followed three main lines, which can be distinguished by how much they concede: (1) Some critics concede that the man in the room doesn t understand Chinese, but hold that nevertheless running the program may create comprehension of Chinese by something other than the room operator. These critics object to the inference from the claim that the man in the room does not understand Chinese to the conclusion that no understanding has been created.

is the strategy of The Systems Reply and the Virtual Mind Reply. These replies hold that the output of the room might reflect real understanding of Chinese, but the understanding would not be that of the room operator. Thus Searle s claim that he doesn t understand Chinese while running the room is conceded, but his claim that there is no understanding of the questions in Chinese, and that computationalism is false, is denied. (2) Other critics concede Searle s claim that just running a natural language processing program as described in the CR scenario does not create any understanding, whether by a human or a computer system.

(e.g. Sprevak 2007) object to the assumption that any system (e.g. Searle in the room) can run any computer program. And finally some have argued that if it is not reasonable to attribute understanding on the basis of the behavior exhibited by the Chinese Room, then it would not be reasonable to attribute understanding to humans on the basis of similar behavioral evidence (Searle calls this last the Other Minds Reply ). This objection to the CRA is that we should be willing to attribute understanding in the Chinese Room on the basis of the overt behavior, just as we do with other humans (and some animals), and as we would do with extra-terrestrial aliens (or burning bushes or angels) that spoke our language. This position is close to Turing s own, when he proposed his behavioral test for machine intelligence.

The Systems Reply In the original BBS article, Searle identified and discussed several responses to the argument that he had come across in giving the argument in talks at various places. As a result, these early responses have received the most attention in subsequent discussion. What Searle 1980 calls perhaps the most common reply is the Systems Reply. The Systems Reply (which Searle says was originally associated with Yale, the home of Schank s AI work) concedes that the man in the room does not understand Chinese.

larger system includes the huge database, the memory (scratchpads) containing intermediate states, and the instructions  the complete system that is required for answering the Chinese questions. So the Systems Reply is that while the man running the program does not understand Chinese, the system as a whole does. Ned Block was one of the first to press the Systems Reply, along with many others including Jack Copeland, Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, Jerry Fodor, John Haugeland, Ray Kurzweil and Georges Rey. Rey (1986) says the person in the room is just the CPU of the system.

hews to the spirit of the Turing Test and holds that if the system displays the apparent capacity to understand Chinese it would have to, indeed, understand Chinese  Searle is contradicting himself in saying in effect, the machine speaks Chinese but doesn t understand Chinese . Margaret Boden (1988) raises levels considerations. Computational psychology does not credit the brain with seeing bean-sprouts or understanding English: intentional states such as these are properties of people, not of brains (244)  a person is an agent that is not identical with a brain or a body. In short, Searle s description of the robot s pseudo-brain (that is, of Searle-in-the-robot) as understanding English involves a category-mistake comparable to treating the brain as the bearer, as opposed to the causal basis, of intelligence .

there is no entailment from this to the claim that the simulation as a whole does not come to understand Chinese. The fallacy involved in moving from part to whole is even more glaring here than in the original version of the Chinese Room Argument . Copeland denies that connectionism implies that a room of people can simulate the brain. Shaffer 2009 examines modal aspects of the logic of the CRA and argues that familiar versions of the System Reply are question-begging.

appears to follow Searle in linking understanding and states of consciousness: Harnad 2012 (Other Internet Resources) argues that Searle shows that the core problem of conscious feeling requires sensory connections to the real world. (See sections below The Robot Reply and Intentionality for discussion.) Finally some have argued that even if the room operator memorizes the rules and does all the operations inside his head, the room operator does not become the system. Cole (1984) and Block (1998) both argue that the result would not be identity of Searle with the system but much more like a case of multiple personality  distinct persons in a single head.

the Systems Reply, the Virtual Mind reply (VMR) holds that a running system may create new, virtual, entities that are distinct from both the system as a whole, as well as from the sub-systems such as the CPU or operator. In particular, a running system might create a distinct agent that understands Chinese. This virtual agent would be distinct from both the room operator and the entire system. The psychological traits, including linguistic abilities, of any mind created by artificial intelligence will depend entirely upon the program and the Chinese database, and will not be identical with the psychological traits and abilities of a CPU or the operator of a paper machine, such as Searle in the Chinese Room scenario.

claim at issue for AI should simply be whether the running computer creates understanding of Chinese . For example, John Haugeland writes (2002) that Searle s response to the Systems Reply is flawed:  what he now asks is what it would be like if he, in his own mind, were consciously to implement the underlying formal structures and operations that the theory says are sufficient to implement another mind . According to Haugeland, his failure to understand Chinese is irrelevant: he is just the implementer. The implemented mind would understand  there is a level-of-description fallacy.

in video games have various abilities and personalities, and the characters are not identical with the system hardware or program that creates them. A single running system might control two distinct virtual agents, or physical robots, simultaneously, one of which converses only in Chinese and one of which can converse only in English, and which otherwise manifest very different personalities, memories, and cognitive abilities. For the Systems Reply, the system understands, whereas for the VM reply, the running system creates a new, virtual, mind that is not identical with the system or the physical implementation. Thus the VM reply asks us to distinguish between minds and their realizing systems.

his widely-read 1989 paper Computation and Consciousness , Tim Maudlin considers minimal physical systems that might implement a computational system running a program. His discussion revolves around his imaginary Olympia machine, a system of buckets that transfer water, implementing a Turing machine. Maudlin s main target is the computationalists claim that such a machine could have phenomenal consciousness. However in the course of his discussion, Maudlin considers the Chinese Room argument.

Searle has done nothing to discount the possibility of simultaneously existing disjoint mentalities (414 5). Perlis (1992), Chalmers (1996) and Block (2002) have apparently endorsed versions of a Virtual Mind reply as well, as has Richard Hanley in The Metaphysics of Star Trek (1997). Penrose (2002) is a critic of this strategy, and Stevan Harnad scornfully dismisses such heroic resorts to metaphysics.

(1996) notes that the room operator is just a causal facilitator, a demon , so that his states of consciousness are irrelevant to the properties of the system as a whole. Like Maudlin, Chalmers raises issues of personal identity  we might regard the Chinese Room as two mental systems realized within the same physical space. The organization that gives rise to the Chinese experiences is quite distinct from the organization that gives rise to the demon s [ room operator s] experiences (326). Cole (1991, 1994) develops the reply and argues as follows: Searle s argument requires that the agent of understanding be the computer itself or, in the Chinese Room parallel, the person in the room.

the time Searle was pressing the CRA, many in philosophy of language and mind were recognizing the importance of causal connections to the world as the source of meaning or reference for words and concepts. Hilary Putnam 1981 argued that a Brain in a Vat, isolated from the world but with neurons connected to a computer that generated a virtual world, might speak or think in a language that sounded like English, but it would not be English  hence a brain in a vat could not wonder if it was a brain in a vat (because of its sensory isolation, its words brain and vat do not refer to brains or vats). The view that meaning was determined by connections with the world became widespread. Searle however resisted this turn outward and continued to think of meaning as subjective and connected with consciousness.

of the key considerations is that in Searle s discussion the actual conversation with the Chinese Room is always seriously under specified. Searle was considering Schank s programs, which can only respond to a few questions about what happened in a restaurant, all in third person. But Searle wishes his conclusions to apply to any AI-produced responses, including those that would pass the toughest unrestricted Turing Test, i.e. they would be just the sort of conversations real people have with each other. If we flesh out the conversation in the original CR scenario to include questions in Chinese such as How tall are you , Where do you live , What did you have for breakfast , What is your attitude toward Mao , and so forth, it immediately becomes clear that the answers in Chinese are not Searle s answers. Searle is not the author of the answers, and his beliefs and desires, memories and personality traits (apart from his industriousness ) are not reflected in the answers and in general Searle s traits are causally inert in producing the answers to the Chinese questions."

suggests the following conditional is true: if there is understanding of Chinese created by running the program, the mind understanding the Chinese would not be the computer, whether the computer is human or electronic. The person understanding the Chinese would be a distinct person from the room operator, with beliefs and desires bestowed by the program and its database. Hence Searle s failure to understand Chinese while operating the room does not show that understanding is not being created. Cole (1991) offers an additional argument that the mind doing the understanding is neither the mind of the room operator nor the system consisting of the operator and the program: running a suitably structured computer program might produce answers submitted in Chinese and also answers to questions submitted in Korean.

the behavioral evidence would be that there were two non-identical minds (one understanding Chinese only, and one understanding Korean only). Since these might have mutually exclusive properties, they cannot be identical, and ipso facto, cannot be identical with the mind of the implementer in the room. Alternatively, we can flesh out Searle s scenario by supposing those outside the room not only submit questions in Chinese, but also in English. The result would appear to be that there are two individuals in the Room  Searle answering questions about himself and what he believes to be the case, and a Chinese speaker with a different personal history and knowledge of the world.

inconsistent cognitive traits cannot be traits of the XBOX system that realizes them. Cole argues that the implication is that minds and persons generally are more abstract than the physical systems that realize them (see Mind and Body in the Larger Philosophical Issues section). In short, the Virtual Mind argument is that since the evidence that Searle provides that there is no understanding of Chinese was that he wouldn t understand Chinese in the room, the Chinese Room Argument cannot refute a differently formulated equally strong AI claim, asserting the possibility of using a programmed digital computer to create a distinct mind that understands a natural language. Maudlin (1989) says that Searle has not adequately responded to this criticism. Others however have replied to the VMR, including Stevan Harnad and mathematical physicist Roger Penrose."

is generally sympathetic to the points Searle raises with the Chinese Room argument, and has argued against the Virtual Mind reply. Penrose does not believe that computational processes can account for consciousness, both on Chinese Room grounds, as well as because of limitations on formal systems revealed by Kurt G del s incompleteness proof. (Penrose has two books on mind and consciousness; Chalmers and others have responded to Penrose s appeals to G del.)In his 2002 article Consciousness, Computation, and the Chinese Room that specifically addresses the Chinese Room argument, Penrose argues that the Chinese Gym variation  with a room expanded to the size of India, with Indians doing the processing  shows it is very implausible to hold there is some kind of disembodied understanding associated with the person s carrying out of that algorithm, and whose presence does not impinge in any way upon his own consciousness (230 1).

Kaernbach (2005) reports that he subjected the virtual mind theory to an empirical test, with negative results. 4.2 The Robot Reply The Robot Reply concedes Searle is right about the Chinese Room scenario: it shows that a computer trapped in a computer room cannot understand language, or know what words mean. The Robot reply is responsive to the problem of knowing the meaning of the Chinese word for hamburger  Searle s example of something the room operator would not know. It seems reasonable to hold that most of us know what a hamburger is because we have seen one, and perhaps even made one, or tasted one, or at least heard people talk about hamburgers and understood what they are by relating them to things we do know by seeing, making, and tasting. Given this is how one might come to know what hamburgers are, the Robot Reply suggests that we put a digital computer in a robot body, with sensors, such as video cameras and microphones, and add effectors, such as wheels to move around with, and arms with which to manipulate things in the world."

a robot  a computer with a body  might do what a child does, learn by seeing and doing. The Robot Reply holds that such a digital computer in a robot body, freed from the room, could attach meanings to symbols and actually understand natural language. Margaret Boden, Tim Crane, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, Stevan Harnad, Hans Moravec and Georges Rey are among those who have endorsed versions of this reply at one time or another. The Robot Reply in effect appeals to wide content or externalist semantics .

rely on environmental features for the success of their behavior. So whether one takes a mind to be a symbol processing system, with the symbols getting their content from sensory connections with the world, or a non-symbolic system that succeeds by being embedded in a particular environment, the importance of things outside the head have come to the fore. Hence many are sympathetic to some form of the Robot Reply: a computational system might understand, provided it is acting in the world. For example, Carter 2007 in a textbook on philosophy and AI concludes The lesson to draw from the Chinese Room thought experiment is that embodied experience is necessary for the development of semantics.

the sensors can do is provide additional input to the computer  and it will be just syntactic input. We can see this by making a parallel change to the Chinese Room scenario. Suppose the man in the Chinese Room receives, in addition to the Chinese characters slipped under the door, a stream of binary digits that appear, say, on a ticker tape in a corner of the room. The instruction books are augmented to use the numerals from the tape as input, along with the Chinese characters.

argues that additional syntactic inputs will do nothing to allow the man to associate meanings with the Chinese characters. It is just more work for the man in the room. Jerry Fodor, Hilary Putnam, and David Lewis, were principal architects of the computational theory of mind that Searle s wider argument attacks. In his original 1980 reply to Searle, Fodor allows Searle is certainly right that instantiating the same program as the brain does is not, in and of itself, sufficient for having those propositional attitudes, e.g. beliefs, characteristic of the organism that has the brain.

computer might have beliefs about, and knowledge of, the world if it has the right causal connections to the world  but those are not ones mediated by a man sitting in the head of the robot. We don t know what the right causal connections are. Searle commits the fallacy of inferring from the little man is not the right causal connection to conclude that no causal linkage would succeed. There is considerable empirical evidence that mental processes involve manipulation of symbols ; Searle gives us no alternative explanation (this is sometimes called Fodor s Only Game in Town argument for computational approaches). In the 1980s and 1990s Fodor wrote extensively on what the connections must be between a brain state and the world for the state to have intentional (representational) properties, while coming to emphasize that computationalism has limits because the computations are intrinsically local and so cannot account for abductive reasoning, that is inference to the best explanation."

a later piece, Yin and Yang in the Chinese Room (in Rosenthal 1991 pp.524 525), Fodor substantially revises his 1980 view. He distances himself from his earlier version of the robot reply, and holds instead that instantiation should be defined in such a way that the symbol must be the proximate cause of the effect  no intervening guys in a room. So Searle in the room is not an instantiation of a Turing Machine, and Searle s setup does not instantiate the machine that the brain instantiates. He concludes:  Searle s setup is irrelevant to the claim that strong equivalence to a Chinese speaker s brain is ipso facto sufficient for speaking Chinese.

claims that precisely because the man in the Chinese room sets out to implement the steps in the computer program, he is not implementing the steps in the computer program. He offers no argument for this extraordinary claim. (in Rosenthal 1991, p. 525) In a 1986 paper, Georges Rey advocated a combination of the system and robot reply, after noting that the original Turing Test is insufficient as a test of intelligence and understanding, and that the isolated system Searle describes in the room is certainly not functionally equivalent to a real Chinese speaker sensing and acting in the world. In a 2002 second look, Searle s Misunderstandings of Functionalism and Strong AI , Rey again defends functionalism against Searle, and in the particular form Rey calls the computational-representational theory of thought  CRTT .

is it committed to a conversation manual model of understanding natural language. Rather, CRTT is concerned with intentionality, natural and artificial (the representations in the system are semantically evaluable  they are true or false, hence have aboutness). Searle saddles functionalism with the blackbox character of behaviorism, but functionalism cares how things are done. Rey sketches a modest mind  a CRTT system that has perception, can make deductive and inductive inferences, makes decisions on basis of goals and representations of how the world is, and can process natural language by converting to and from its native representations.

we flesh out the Chinese conversation in the context of the Robot Reply, just as with the Virtual Mind Reply, we may again see evidence that the entity that understands is not the operator inside the room. Suppose we ask the robot system using the Chinese translation of what do you see , we might get the answer My old friend Shakey , or I see you . Whereas if we phone Searle in the room and ask the same questions in English we might get These same four walls or these damn endless instruction books and notebooks. Again this is evidence that we have distinct responders here, an English speaker and a Chinese speaker, who see and do quite different things.

AI research area seeks to replicate key human learning abilities, such as robots that are shown an object from several angles while being told in natural language the name of the object. Margaret Boden 1988 also argues that Searle mistakenly supposes programs are pure syntax. But programs bring about the activity of certain machines: The inherent procedural consequences of any computer program give it a toehold in semantics, where the semantics in question is not denotational, but causal. (250) Thus a robot might have causal powers that enable it to refer to a hamburger.

he thinks this counts against symbolic accounts of mentality, such as Jerry Fodor s, and, one suspects, the approach of Roger Schank that was Searle s original target. Harnad 2012 (Other Internet Resources) argues that the CRA shows that even with a robot with symbols grounded in the external world, there is still something missing: feeling, such as the feeling of understanding. However Ziemke 2016 argues a robotic embodiment with layered systems of bodily regulation may ground emotion and meaning, and Seligman 2019 argues that perceptually grounded approaches to natural language processing (NLP) have the potential to display intentionality, and thus after all to foster a truly meaningful semantics that, in the view of Searle and other skeptics, is intrinsically beyond computers capacity. 4.3 The Brain Simulator Reply Consider a computer that operates in quite a different manner than an AI program with scripts and operations on sentence-like strings of symbols.

the computer then works the very same way as the brain of a native Chinese speaker, processing information in just the same way, it will understand Chinese. Paul and Patricia Churchland have set out a reply along these lines, discussed below. In response to this, Searle argues that it makes no difference. He suggests a variation on the brain simulator scenario: suppose that in the room the man has a huge set of valves and water pipes, in the same arrangement as the neurons in a native Chinese speaker s brain.

claims that it is obvious that there would be no understanding of Chinese. (Note however that the basis for this claim is no longer simply that Searle himself wouldn t understand Chinese  it seems clear that now he is just facilitating the causal operation of the system and so we rely on our Leibnizian intuition that water-works don t understand (see also Maudlin 1989).)Searle concludes that a simulation of brain activity is not the real thing. However, following Pylyshyn 1980, Cole and Foelber 1984, and Chalmers 1996, we might wonder about gradually transitioning cyborg systems. Pylyshyn writes: If more and more of the cells in your brain were to be replaced by integrated circuit chips, programmed in such a way as to keep the input-output function each unit identical to that of the unit being replaced, you would in all likelihood just keep right on speaking exactly as you are doing now except that you would eventually stop meaning anything by it."

we outside observers might take to be words would become for you just certain noises that circuits caused you to make. These cyborgization thought experiments can be linked to the Chinese Room. Suppose Otto has a neural disease that causes one of the neurons in his brain to fail, but surgeons install a tiny remotely controlled artificial neuron, a synron, alongside his disabled neuron. The control of Otto s artificial neuron is by John Searle in the Chinese Room, unbeknownst to both Searle and Otto.

his artificial neuron is stimulated by neurons that synapse on his disabled neuron, a light goes on in the Chinese Room. Searle then manipulates some valves and switches in accord with a program. That, via the radio link, causes Otto s artificial neuron to release neuro-transmitters from its tiny artificial vesicles. If Searle s programmed activity causes Otto s artificial neuron to behave just as his disabled natural neuron once did, the behavior of the rest of his nervous system will be unchanged.

hypothesi the rest of the world will not notice the difference; will Otto If so, when And why  Under the rubric The Combination Reply , Searle also considers a system with the features of all three of the preceding: a robot with a digital brain simulating computer in its aluminum cranium, such that the system as a whole behaves indistinguishably from a human. Since the normal input to the brain is from sense organs, it is natural to suppose that most advocates of the Brain Simulator Reply have in mind such a combination of brain simulation, Robot, and Systems or Virtual Mind Reply. Some (e.g. Rey 1986) argue it is reasonable to attribute intentionality to such a system as a whole. Searle agrees that it would indeed be reasonable to attribute understanding to such an android system  but only as long as you don t know how it works.

assumes this would be true even if it were one s spouse, with whom one had built a life-long relationship, that was revealed to hide a silicon secret. Science fiction stories, including episodes of Rod Serling s television series The Twilight Zone, have been based on such possibilities (the face of the beloved peels away to reveal the awful android truth); however, Steven Pinker (1997) mentions one episode in which the android s secret was known from the start, but the protagonist still developed a romantic relationship with the android.) On its tenth anniversary the Chinese Room argument was featured in the general science periodical Scientific American. Leading the opposition to Searle s lead article in that issue were philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland.

Clark holds that Searle is right that a computer running Schank s program does not know anything about restaurants, at least if by know we mean anything like understand . But Searle thinks that this would apply to any computational model, while Clark, like the Churchlands, holds that Searle is wrong about connectionist models. Clark s interest is thus in the brain-simulator reply. The brain thinks in virtue of its physical properties.

Clark s views are not unlike the Churchlands , conceding that Searle is right about Schank and symbolic-level processing systems, but holding that he is mistaken about connectionist systems. Similarly Ray Kurzweil (2002) argues that Searle s argument could be turned around to show that human brains cannot understand  the brain succeeds by manipulating neurotransmitter concentrations and other mechanisms that are in themselves meaningless. In criticism of Searle s response to the Brain Simulator Reply, Kurzweil says: So if we scale up Searle s Chinese Room to be the rather massive room it needs to be, who s to say that the entire system of a hundred trillion people simulating a Chinese Brain that knows Chinese isn t conscious Certainly, it would be correct to say that such a system knows Chinese.

cognitive sciences one presupposes the reality and knowability of the mental in the same way that in physical sciences one has to presuppose the reality and knowability of physical objects. Critics of Searle s claim here argue that if the evidence we have that humans understand is the same as the evidence we might have that a visiting extra-terrestrial alien understands, which is the same as the evidence that a robot understands, the presuppositions we may make in the case of our own species are not relevant, for presuppositions are sometimes false. For similar reasons, Turing, in proposing the Turing Test, is specifically worried about our presuppositions and chauvinism. If the reasons for the presuppositions regarding humans are pragmatic, in that they enable us to predict the behavior of humans and to interact effectively with them, perhaps the presupposition could apply equally to computers (similar considerations are pressed by Dennett, in his discussions of what he calls the Intentional Stance). Searle raises the question of just what we are attributing in attributing understanding to other minds, saying that it is more than complex behavioral dispositions."

Searle, understanding appears to involve states of consciousness, as is seen in his 2010 summary of the CRA conclusions. Terry Horgan (2013) endorses this claim: the real moral of Searle s Chinese room thought experiment is that genuine original intentionality requires the presence of internal states with intrinsic phenomenal character that is inherently intentional  But this tying of understanding to phenomenal consciousness raises a host of issues. We attribute limited understanding of language to toddlers, dogs, and other animals, but it is not clear that we are ipso facto attributing unseen states of subjective consciousness  what do we know of the hidden states of exotic creatures Ludwig Wittgenstein (the Private Language Argument) and his followers pressed similar points. Altered qualia possibilities, analogous to the inverted spectrum, arise: suppose I ask what s the sum of 5 and 7 and you respond the sum of 5 and 7 is 12 , but as you heard my question you had the conscious experience of hearing and understanding what is the sum of 10 and 14 , though you were in the computational states appropriate for producing the correct sum and so said 12 . Are there certain conscious states that are correct for certain functional states Wittgenstein s considerations appear to be that the subjective state is irrelevant, at best epiphenomenal, if a language user displays appropriate linguistic behavior."

we are taught language on the basis of our overt responses, not our qualia or states of consciousness. The mathematical savant Daniel Tammet reports that when he generates the decimal expansion of pi to thousands of digits he experiences colors that reveal the next digit, but even here it may be that Tennant s performance is likely not produced by the colors he experiences, but rather by unconscious neural computation that produces both the correct answer and the color he experiences. The possible importance of subjective states is further considered in the section on Intentionality, below. Since the CRA there has been philosophical interest in another other-minds problem, namely the possibility of zombies  creatures that look like and behave just as normal humans, including linguistic behavior, yet have no subjective consciousness. A difficulty for claiming that subjective states of consciousness are crucial for understanding meaning will arise in these cases of absent qualia: we can t tell the difference between zombies and non-zombies, and so on Searle s account we can t tell the difference between those that really understand English and those that don t. And if you and I can t tell the difference between those who understand language and Zombies who behave like they do but don t really, than neither can any selection factor in the history of human evolution  for predators, mates, fellow tribe members, zombies and true understanders, with the right conscious experience, have been indistinguishable."

then there appears to be a distinction without a difference. In any case, Searle s short reply to the Other Minds Reply may be too short. Descartes famously argued that speech was sufficient for attributing minds and consciousness to others, and infamously argued that it was necessary. Turing was in effect endorsing Descartes sufficiency condition, at least for intelligence, while substituting written for oral linguistic behavior.

if being con-specific is key on Searle s account, a natural question arises as to what circumstances would justify us in attributing understanding (or consciousness) to extra-terrestrial aliens who do not share our biology Offending ET s by withholding attributions of understanding until after doing a brain scan or post-mortem may be risky. Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University, and author of Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, argues that Searle s position merely reflects intuitions from traditional philosophy of mind that are out of step with the new cognitive science. Moravec endorses a version of the Other Minds reply. It makes sense to attribute intentionality to machines for the same reasons it makes sense to attribute them to humans; his interpretative position is similar to Dennett s view.

holds that such self-representation is at the heart of consciousness. These capacities appear to be implementation independent, and hence possible for aliens and suitably programmed computers. As we have seen, the reason that Searle thinks we can disregard the behavioral evidence in the case of robots and computers is that we know that their processing is syntactic, and this fact trumps all other considerations.

The Intuition Reply Many responses to the Chinese Room argument have noted that, as with Leibniz Mill, the argument appears to be based on intuition: the intuition that a computer (or the man in the room) cannot think or have understanding. For example, Ned Block (1980) in his original BBS commentary says Searle s argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think. But, Block argues, (1) intuitions sometimes can and should be trumped and (2) perhaps we need to bring our concept of understanding in line with a reality in which certain computer robots belong to the same natural kind as humans. Similarly Margaret Boden (1988) points out that we can t trust our untutored intuitions about how mind depends on matter; developments in science may change our intuitions. Indeed, elimination of bias in our intuitions was precisely what motivated Turing (1950) to propose the Turing Test, a test that was blind to the physical character of the system replying to questions."

of Searle s critics in effect argue that he has merely pushed the reliance on intuition back, into the room. For example, one can hold that despite Searle s intuition that he would not understand Chinese while in the room, perhaps he is mistaken and does, albeit unconsciously. Hauser (2002) accuses Searle of Cartesian bias in his inference from it seems to me quite obvious that I understand nothing to the conclusion that I really understand nothing.

man in the Chinese Room might lack the normal introspective awareness of understanding  but this, while abnormal, does not support the conclusion that he does not understand.

ends his discussion by citing a science fiction story in which Aliens, anatomically quite unlike humans, cannot believe that humans can really think once they discover that our heads are filled with meat. The Aliens intuitions are unreliable  presumably ours may be so as well. Clearly the CRA turns on what is required to understand language. Schank 1978 clarifies his claim about what he thinks his programs can do: By understand , we mean SAM [one of his programs] can create a linked causal chain of conceptualizations that represent what took place in each story.

320). Paul Thagard (2013) proposes that for every thought experiment in philosophy there is an equal and opposite thought experiment. Thagard holds that intuitions are unreliable, and the CRA is an example (and that in fact the CRA has now been refuted by the technology of autonomous robotic cars). Dennett has elaborated on concerns about our intuitions regarding intelligence.

operator of the Chinese Room may eventually produce appropriate answers to Chinese questions. But slow thinkers are stupid, not intelligent  and in the wild, they may well end up dead. Dennett argues that speed  is of the essence for intelligence. If you can t figure out the relevant portions of the changing environment fast enough to fend for yourself, you are not practically intelligent, however complex you are (326).

Maudlin (1989) disagrees. Maudlin considers the time-scale problem pointed to by other writers, and concludes, contra Dennett, that the extreme slowness of a computational system does not violate any necessary conditions on thinking or consciousness. Furthermore, Searle s main claim is about understanding, not intelligence or being quick-witted. If we were to encounter extra-terrestrials that could process information a thousand times more quickly than we do, it seems that would show nothing about our own slow-poke ability to understand the languages we speak.

addresses the Chinese Room argument in his book The Mind s New Science (1985, 171 177). Gardiner considers all the standard replies to the Chinese Room argument and concludes that Searle is correct about the room:  the word understand has been unduly stretched in the case of the Chinese room . (175). Thus several in this group of critics argue that speed affects our willingness to attribute intelligence and understanding to a slow system, such as that in the Chinese Room.

it may be that the slowness marks a crucial difference between the simulation in the room and what a fast computer does, such that the man is not intelligent while the computer system is (Dennett). 4.6 Advances in Artificial Intelligence Even as late as 2001, Robert Damper [2001, Other Internet Resources) dismissed the CRA as useless, and possibly harmful, because What Searle and others seem ready blithely to assume  the existence of a Chinese understanding program able to pass the Turing test   is so far beyond the current capabilities of AI and computer technology as to amount to science fiction. What could we possibly learn from such a fanciful conception There is no realistic way of resolving any paradoxes which arise, save appeals to common sense, and we know from the example of quantum mechanics how fallible this is. And in 2015 Steven Pinker remarked Human-level AI is still the standard 15-to-25 years away, just as it always has been .

the many decades since then, there have been enormous advances in areas relevant to the CRA and many of the replies: computing speed and power, robotics, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and to the point, natural language processing. In late 2022, AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) received wide attention, from academics to their essay-writing students, as well as many other professions in which language proficiency was important. Whereas Shank s program and database were hand-built, so that, (once debugged ) their highly limited output of a sentence or two about restaurants could rarely, if ever, surprise the programmers, LLM systems crawl the world wide web and can generate paragraph after paragraph that may be all news to their coders. Does this make any difference to the CRA and its replies Sabine Hossenfelder (2023) argues that these chatbots understand some of what they say, namely they understand in the same sense that humans understand quantum mechanics.

to Doesn t Searle s argument apply to ChatGPT  we get Yes, John Searle s argument does apply to systems like ChatGPT. ChatGPT uses patterns and rules from the vast amounts of text it has been trained on to generate responses. It operates based on statistical correlations between words and phrases, mimicking syntactic structures. ChatGPT doesn t truly understand meaning in the human sense.

paradoxically, the system appears to understand that it doesn t understand. However it fails to notice that these claims are inconsistent with its output made just minutes before. So we are not there yet. A system that answers questions with carefully argued denials that it can understand anything is not going to pass the Turing Test.

consequence may be that if systems that use language just as proficiently as humans in all contexts are argued by a thought experiment to not really understand, then we can t test for real understanding, and it adds nothing to the purposes for which we use language. Really understanding becomes epiphenomenal: undetectable, causally inert, and irrelevant. 5. The Larger Philosophical Issues 5.1 Syntax and Semantics Searle believes the Chinese Room thought experiment supports a larger point, which explains the failure of the Chinese Room to produce understanding.

and according to Searle this is the key point, Syntax is not by itself sufficient for, nor constitutive of, semantics. So although computers may be able to manipulate syntax to produce appropriate responses to natural language input, they do not understand the sentences they receive or output, for they cannot associate meanings with the words. Searle (1984) presents a three premise argument that because syntax is not sufficient for semantics, programs cannot produce minds. Programs are purely formal (syntactic).

by itself is neither constitutive of, nor sufficient for, semantic content. Therefore, programs by themselves are not constitutive of nor sufficient for minds. The Chinese Room thought experiment itself is the support for the third premise. The claim that syntactic manipulation is not sufficient for meaning or thought is a significant issue, with wider implications than AI, or attributions of understanding.

one form, it is held that thought involves operations on symbols in virtue of their physical properties. On an alternative connectionist account, the computations are on subsymbolic states. If Searle is right, not only Strong AI but also these main approaches to understanding human cognition are misguided. As we have seen, Searle holds that the Chinese Room scenario shows that one cannot get semantics from syntax alone.

semantics, if any, comes later. The logician first specifies the basic symbol set and some rules for manipulating strings to produce new ones ( well-formed fomulas ). These rules are purely syntactic  they are applied to strings of symbols solely in virtue of their syntax or form. A semantics, if any, for the symbol system must be provided separately.

on the face of it, semantics is quite independent of syntax for artificial languages, and one cannot get semantics from syntax alone. Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or interpretation, or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them (Searle 1989, 45). Searle s identification of meaning with interpretation in this passage is important. Searle s point is clearly true of the causally inert formal systems of logicians.

we move from formal systems to computational systems, the situation is more complex. As many of Searle s critics (e.g. Cole 1984, Dennett 1987, Boden 1988, and Chalmers 1996) have noted, a computer running a program is not the same as syntax alone . A computer is an enormously complex electronic causal system (some now have transistor counts that are comparable to the number of neurons in a human brain). State changes in the system are physical. One can interpret the physical states, e.g. voltages, as syntactic 1 s and 0 s, but the intrinsic reality is electronic and syntax is derived , a product of someone else s interpretation."

states are syntactically specified by programmers, but when implemented in a running machine they are electronic states of a complex causal system directly or indirectly embedded in the real world. This is quite different from the abstract formal systems that logicians study. Dennett notes that no computer program by itself (Searle s language)  e.g. a program lying on a shelf  can cause anything, even simple addition, let alone mental states. The program must be running. Chalmers (1996) offers a parody in which it is reasoned that recipes are syntactic, syntax is not sufficient for crumbliness, cakes are crumbly, so implementation of a recipe is not sufficient for making a cake."

makes all the difference; an abstract entity (recipe, program) determines the causal powers of a physical system embedded in the larger causal nexus of the world. Dennett (1987) sums up the issue: Searle s view, then, comes to this: take a material object (any material object) that does not have the power of causing mental phenomena; you cannot turn it in to an object that does have the power of producing mental phenomena simply by programming it  reorganizing the conditional dependencies of transitions between its states. Dennett s view is the opposite: programming is precisely what could give something a mind . But Dennett claims that in fact it is empirically unlikely that the right sorts of programs can be run on anything but organic, human brains (325 6).

a computer, there is nothing that literally reads input data, or that knows what symbols are. Instead, there are millions of transistors that change states. A sequence of voltages causes operations to be performed. We humans may choose to interpret these voltages as binary numerals and the voltage changes as syntactic operations, but a computer does not interpret its operations as syntactic or any other way.

perhaps any causal system is describable as performing syntactic operations  if we interpret a light square as logical 0 and a dark square as logical 1 , then a kitchen toaster may be described as a device that rewrites logical 0 s as logical 1 s. But there is no philosophical problem about getting from syntax to breakfast. In the 1990s, Searle began to use considerations related to these to argue that computational views are not just false, but lack a clear sense. Computation, or syntax, is observer-relative , not an intrinsic feature of reality:  you can assign a computational interpretation to anything (Searle 2002b, p. 17), even the molecules in the paint on the wall. Since nothing is intrinsically computational, one cannot have a scientific theory that reduces the mental, which is not observer-relative, to computation, which is.

is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years ago, but I did not. (Searle 2002b, p.17, originally published 1993). Critics note that walls are not computers; unlike a wall, a computer goes through state-transitions that are counterfactually described by a program (Chalmers 1996, Block 2002, Haugeland 2002). In his 2002 paper, Block addresses the question of whether a wall is a computer (in reply to Searle s charge that anything that maps onto a formal system is a formal system, whereas minds are quite different)."

denies that whether or not something is a computer depends entirely on our interpretation. Block notes that Searle ignores the counterfactuals that must be true of an implementing system. Haugeland (2002) makes the similar point that an implementation will be a causal process that reliably carries out the operations  and they must be the right causal powers. Block concludes that Searle s arguments fail, but he concedes that they do succeed in sharpening our understanding of the nature of intentionality and its relation to computation and representation (78).

infers this from the fact that syntactic properties (e.g. being a logical 1 ) are not defined in physics; however Rey holds that it does not follow that they are observer-relative. Rey argues that Searle also misunderstands what it is to realize a program. Rey endorses Chalmers reply to Putnam: a realization is not just a structural mapping, but involves causation, supporting counterfactuals. This point is missed so often, it bears repeating: the syntactically specifiable objects over which computations are defined can and standardly do possess a semantics; it s just that the semantics is not involved in the specification.

concludes: Searle simply does not consider the substantial resources of functionalism and Strong AI. (222) A plausibly detailed story would defuse negative conclusions drawn from the superficial sketch of the system in the Chinese Room. John Haugeland (2002) argues that there is a sense in which a processor must intrinsically understand the commands in the programs it runs: it executes them in accord with the specifications. The only way that we can make sense of a computer as executing a program is by understanding its processor as responding to the program prescriptions as meaningful (385).

goes on to draw a distinction between narrow and wide system. He argues that data can have semantics in the wide system that includes representations of external objects produced by transducers. In passing, Haugeland makes the unusual claim, argued for elsewhere, that genuine intelligence and semantics presuppose the capacity for a kind of commitment in how one lives which is non-propositional  that is, love (compare Steven Spielberg s 2001 film Artificial Intelligence: AI). To Searle s claim that syntax is observer-relative, that the molecules in a wall might be interpreted as implementing the Wordstar program (an early word processing program) because there is some pattern in the molecule movements which is isomorphic with the formal structure of Wordstar (Searle 1990b, p. 27), Haugeland counters that the very idea of a complex syntactical token  presupposes specified processes of writing and reading . The tokens must be systematically producible and retrievable."

no random isomorphism or pattern somewhere (e.g. on some wall) is going to count, and hence syntax is not observer-relative. With regard to the question of whether one can get semantics from syntax, William Rapaport has for many years argued for syntactic semantics , a view in which understanding is a special form of syntactic structure in which symbols (such as Chinese words) are linked to concepts, themselves represented syntactically. Others believe we are not there yet. AI futurist (The Age of Spiritual Machines) Ray Kurzweil holds in a 2002 follow-up book that it is red herring to focus on traditional symbol-manipulating computers.

that failure does not bear on the capacity of future computers based on different technology. Kurzweil claims that Searle fails to understand that future machines will use chaotic emergent methods that are massively parallel . This claim appears to be similar to that of connectionists, such as Andy Clark, and the position taken by the Churchlands in their 1990 Scientific American article. Apart from Haugeland s claim that processors understand program instructions, Searle s critics can agree that computers no more understand syntax than they understand semantics, although, like all causal engines, a computer has syntactic descriptions. And while it is often useful to programmers to treat the machine as if it performed syntactic operations, it is not always so: sometimes the characters programmers use are just switches that make the machine do something, for example, make a given pixel on the computer display turn red, or make a car transmission shift gears."

it is not clear that Searle is correct when he says a digital computer is just a device which manipulates symbols . Computers are complex causal engines, and syntactic descriptions are useful in order to structure the causal interconnections in the machine. AI programmers face many tough problems, but one can hold that they do not have to get semantics from syntax. If they are to get semantics, they must get it from causality.

internalist approaches, such as Schank s and Rapaport s conceptual representation approaches, and also Conceptual Role Semantics, hold that a state of a physical system gets its semantics from causal connections to other states of the same system. Thus a state of a computer might represent kiwi because it is connected to bird and flightless nodes, and perhaps also to images of prototypical kiwis. The state that represents the property of being flightless might get its content from a Negation-operator modifying a representation of capable of airborne self-propulsion , and so forth, to form a vast connected conceptual network, a kind of mental dictionary. Externalist approaches developed by Dennis Stampe, Fred Dretske, Hilary Putnam, Jerry Fodor, Ruth Millikan, and others, hold that states of a physical system get their content through causal connections to the external reality they represent.

kiwi-representing state will be a state that is appropriately causally connected to the presence of kiwis. Depending on the system, the kiwi representing state could be a state of a brain, or of an electrical device such as a computer, or even of a hydraulic system. The internal representing state can in turn play a causal role in determining the behavior of the system.

computer in a robot body might have just the causal connections that could allow its inner syntactic states to have the semantic property of representing states of things in its environment. Thus there are at least two families of theories (and marriages of the two, as in Block 1986) about how semantics might depend upon causal connections. Both of these attempt to provide accounts that are implementation neutral: states of suitably organized causal systems can have content, no matter what the systems are made of. On these theories a computer could have states that have meaning.

and desires are intentional states: they have propositional content (a person never just believes or desires, they believe that p, or desire that p, where sentences or clauses that represent propositions substitute for p ). Searle s views regarding intentionality are complex; of relevance here is that he makes a distinction between the original or intrinsic intentionality of genuine mental states, and the derived intentionality of language. A written or spoken sentence only has intentionality, namely derived intentionality, insofar as it is interpreted by someone. It appears that on Searle s view, original intentionality must at least potentially be conscious.

can interpret the states of a computer as having content, but the states themselves do not have original intentionality. Many philosophers endorse this intentionality dualism, including Sayre (1986) and even Fodor (2009), despite Fodor s many differences with Searle. In a section of her 1988 book, Computer Models of the Mind, Margaret Boden notes that intentionality is not well-understood  reason to not put too much weight on arguments that turn on intentionality. Furthermore, insofar as we understand the brain, we focus on informational functions, not unspecified causal powers of the brain:  from the psychological point of view, it is not the biochemistry as such which matters but the information-bearing functions grounded in it.

the same time, in the Chinese Room scenario, Searle maintains that a system can exhibit behavior just as complex as human behavior, simulating any degree of intelligence and language comprehension that one can imagine, and simulating any ability to deal with the world, yet not understand a thing. He also says that such behaviorally complex systems might be implemented with very ordinary materials, for example with tubes of water and valves. This creates a biological problem, beyond the Other Minds problem noted by early critics of the CR argument. While we may presuppose that others have minds, evolution makes no such presuppositions.

Jacquette 1989 argues against a reduction of intentionality  intentionality, he says, is an ineliminable, irreducible primitive concept. However, most AI sympathizers have seen intentionality, aboutness, as bound up with information, and non-biological states can carry information just as well as can brain states. Hence many responders to Searle have argued that he displays substance chauvinism, in holding that brains understand but systems made of silicon with comparable information processing capabilities cannot, even in principle. Papers on both sides of the issue appeared, such as J. Maloney s 1987 paper The Right Stuff , defending Searle, and R. Sharvy s 1983 critique, It Ain t the Meat, it s the Motion .

critics of Searle s position take intentionality more seriously than Boden does, but deny his dualistic distinction between original and derived intentionality. Dennett (1987, e.g.) argues that all intentionality is derived, in that attributions of intentionality  to animals, other people, and even ourselves  are purely instrumental and allow us to predict behavior, but they are not descriptions of intrinsic properties. As we have seen, Dennett is concerned about the slow speed of things in the Chinese Room, but he argues that once a system is working up to speed, it has all that is needed for a mind with derived intentionality  and derived intentionality is the only kind that there is, according to Dennett. A machine can be an intentional system because intentional explanations work in predicting the machine s behavior.

his syntax-semantic arguments, Searle has apparently confused a claim about the underivability of semantics from syntax with a claim about the underivability of the consciousness of semantics from syntax (336). The emphasis on consciousness forces us to think about things from a first-person point of view, but Dennett 2017 continues to press the claim that this is a fundamental mistake if we want to understand the mental. We might also worry that Searle conflates meaning and interpretation, and that Searle s original or underived intentionality is just second-order intentionality, a representation of what an intentional object represents or means. Dretske and others have seen intentionality as information-based.

it is a mistake to hold that conscious attributions of meaning are the source of intentionality. Others have noted that Searle s discussion has shown a shift over time from issues of intentionality and understanding to issues of consciousness. Searle links intentionality to awareness of intentionality, in holding that intentional states are at least potentially conscious. In his 1996 book, The Conscious Mind, David Chalmers notes that although Searle originally directs his argument against machine intentionality, it is clear from later writings that the real issue is consciousness, which Searle holds is a necessary condition of intentionality.

uses thought experiments to argue that it is implausible that one system has some basic mental property (such as having qualia) that another system lacks, if it is possible to imagine transforming one system into the other, either gradually (as replacing neurons one at a time by digital circuits), or all at once, switching back and forth between flesh and silicon (see the brief discussion of cyborgization in section 4.3 above). A second strategy regarding the attribution of intentionality is taken by critics who in effect argue that intentionality is an intrinsic feature of states of physical systems that are causally connected with the world in the right way, independently of interpretation (see the preceding Syntax and Semantics section). For example, a photo of Turing has intentionality: it has content about something, namely Turing. This form of intentionality is independent of interpretation  someone can look at a photo of Turing and think it is a photo of someone else.

sentence is about a specific robot in virtue of causal connection between the generation of the sentence and the location of the robot. When the robot generates that sentence, it means that the robot is in a room it calls clock-room . But someone might interpret and assign the wrong intentionality to it (e.g. they might think it is about some other robot than it actually is about). On this way of thinking about it, intentionality is one thing, and interpretation is something else, namely interpretation is a theory or hypothesis about something s intentionality.

s semantic externalism is influenced by Fred Dretske, but they come to different conclusions with regard to the semantics of states of computers. Over a period of years, Dretske developed an historical account of meaning or mental content that would preclude attributing beliefs and understanding to most machines. Dretske (1985) agrees with Searle that adding machines don t literally add; we do the adding, using the machines. Dretske emphasizes the crucial role of natural selection and learning in producing states that have genuine content.

final resting places of powerful Pharaohs. Of the possible 63 tombs in the valley, there is one that outshines the rest, and has captured the world's imagination. The tomb of Tutankhamun.

states will generally be counterfeits of real mental states; like counterfeit money, they may appear perfectly identical but lack the right pedigree. But Dretske s account of belief appears to make it distinct from conscious awareness of the belief or intentional state (if that is taken to require a higher order thought), and so would apparently allow attribution of intentionality to artificial systems that can get the right history by learning. Howard Gardiner endorses Zenon Pylyshyn s criticisms of Searle s view of the relation of brain and intentionality, as supposing that intentionality is somehow a stuff secreted by the brain , and Pylyshyn s own counter-thought experiment in which one s neurons are replaced one by one with integrated circuit workalikes (see also Cole and Foelber (1984) and Chalmers (1996) for exploration of neuron replacement scenarios). Gardiner holds that Searle owes us a more precise account of intentionality than Searle has given so far, and until then it is an open question whether AI can produce it, or whether it is beyond its scope.

Mind and Body Several critics have noted that there are metaphysical issues at stake in the original argument. The Systems Reply draws attention to the metaphysical problem of the relation of mind to body. It does this in holding that understanding is a property of the system as a whole, not the physical implementer. The Virtual Mind Reply holds that minds or persons  the entities that understand and are conscious  are more abstract than any physical system, and that there could be a many-to-one relation between minds and physical systems. (Even if everything is physical, in principle a single body could be shared by multiple minds, and a single mind could have a sequence of bodies over time.)"

larger issues about personal identity and the relation of mind and body are in play in the debate between Searle and some of his critics. Searle s view is that the problem of the relation of mind and body has a rather simple solution. Here it is: Conscious states are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain and are themselves higher level features of the brain (Searle 2002b, p. 9). In his early discussion of the CRA, Searle spoke of the causal powers of the brain.

as we have seen, even if this is true it begs the question of just whose consciousness a brain creates. Roger Sperry s split-brain experiments suggest that perhaps there can be two centers of consciousness, and so in that sense two minds, implemented by a single brain. While both display at least some language comprehension, only one (typically created by the left hemisphere) controls language production. Thus many current approaches to understanding the relation of brain and consciousness emphasize connectedness and information flow (see e.g. Dehaene 2014).

very concrete metaphysics is reflected in Searle s original presentation of the CR argument, in which Strong AI was described by him as the claim that the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind (Searle 1980). This is an identity claim, and has odd consequences. If A and B are identical, any property of A is a property of B. Computers are physical objects.

it seems to be clear that while humans may weigh 150 pounds; human minds do not weigh 150 pounds. This suggests that neither bodies nor machines can literally be minds. Such considerations support the view that minds are more abstract than brains, and if so that at least one version of the claim that Searle calls Strong AI, the version that says that computers literally are minds, is metaphysically untenable on the face of it, apart from any thought-experiments. If minds are not physical objects this inability of a computer to be a mind does not show that running an AI program cannot produce understanding of natural language, by something other than the computer (See section 4.1 above.)

is an alternative to the identity theory that is implicit in much of Searle s discussion, as well as to the dominant behaviorism of the mid-twentieth Century. If functionalism is correct, there appears to be no intrinsic reason why a computer couldn t have mental states. Hence the CRA s conclusion that a computer is intrinsically incapable of mental states is an important consideration against functionalism. Julian Baggini (2009, 37) writes that Searle came up with perhaps the most famous counter-example in history  the Chinese room argument  and in one intellectual punch inflicted so much damage on the then dominant theory of functionalism that many would argue it has never recovered. Functionalists hold that a mental state is what a mental state does  the causal (or functional ) role that the state plays determines what state it is."

functionalist might hold that pain, for example, is a state that is typically caused by damage to the body, is located in a body-image, and is aversive. Functionalists distance themselves both from behaviorists and identity theorists. In contrast with the former, functionalists hold that the internal causal processes are important for the possession of mental states. Thus functionalists may agree with Searle in rejecting the Turing Test as too behavioristic. In contrast with identity theorists (who might e.g. hold pain is identical with C-fiber firing ), functionalists hold that mental states might be had by a variety of physical systems (or non-physical, as in Cole and Foelber 1984, in which a mind changes from a material to an immaterial implementation, neuron by neuron)."

while an identity theorist will identify pain with certain neuron firings, a functionalist will identify pain with something more abstract and higher level, a functional role that might be had by many different types of underlying system. Functionalists accuse identity theorists of substance chauvinism. However, functionalism remains controversial: functionalism is vulnerable to the Chinese Nation type objections discussed above, and functionalists notoriously have trouble explaining qualia, a problem highlighted by the apparent possibility of an inverted spectrum, where qualitatively different states might have the same functional role (e.g. Block 1978, Maudlin 1989, Cole 1990). Computationalism is the sub-species of functionalism that holds that the important causal role of brain processes is information processing.

Jerry Fodor, an early proponent of computational approaches, argues in Fodor 2005 that key mental processes, such as inference to the best explanation, which depend on non-local properties of representations, cannot be explained by computational modules in the brain. If Fodor is right, understanding language and interpretation appear to involve global considerations such as linguistic and non-linguistic context and theory of mind and so might resist computational explanation. If so, we reach Searle s conclusion on the basis of different considerations. Searle s 2010 statement of the conclusion of the CRA has it showing that computational accounts cannot explain consciousness.

interest has been in the neural correlates of consciousness. This bears directly on Searle s claim that consciousness is intrinsically biological and not computational or information processing. There is no definitive answer yet, though some recent work on anesthesia suggests that consciousness is lost when cortical (and cortico-thalamic) connections and information flow are disrupted (e.g., Hudetz 2012, a review article). In general, if the basis of consciousness is confirmed to be at the relatively abstract level of information flow through neural networks, it will be friendly to functionalism, and if it is turns out to be lower and more biological (or sub-neuronal), it will be friendly to Searle s account. 5.4 Simulation, duplication and evolution In discussing the CRA, Searle argues that there is an important distinction between simulation and duplication."

are biological if anything is. Are artificial hearts simulations of hearts Or are they functional duplicates of hearts, hearts made from different materials Walking is normally a biological phenomenon performed using limbs. Do those with artificial limbs walk Or do they simulate walking Do robots walk If the properties that are needed to be a certain kind of thing are high-level properties, anything sharing those properties will be a thing of that kind, even if it differs in its lower level properties. Chalmers (1996) offers a principle governing when simulation is replication. Chalmers suggests that, contra Searle and Harnad (1989), a simulation of X can be an X, namely when the property of being an X is an organizational invariant, a property that depends only on the functional organization of the underlying system, and not on any other details."

(2002) argues that the Church-Turing thesis does not entail that the brain (or every machine) can be simulated by a universal Turing machine, for the brain (or other machine) might have primitive operations that are not simple clerical routines that can be carried out by hand. (An example might be that human brains likely display genuine low-level randomness, whereas computers are carefully designed not to do that, and so computers resort to pseudo-random numbers when apparent randomness is needed.)Sprevak 2007 raises a related point. Turing s 1938 Princeton thesis described such machines ( O-machines ). O-machines are machines that include functions of natural numbers that are not Turing-machine computable."

the brain is such a machine, then, says Sprevak,: There is no possibility of Searle s Chinese Room Argument being successfully deployed against the functionalist hypothesis that the brain instantiates an O-machine . (120). Copeland discusses the simulation / duplication distinction in connection with the Brain Simulator Reply. He argues that Searle correctly notes that one cannot infer from X simulates Y, and Y has property P, to the conclusion that therefore X has Y s property P for arbitrary P. But Copeland claims that Searle himself commits the simulation fallacy in extending the CR argument from traditional AI to apply against computationalism.

faulty step is: the CR operator S simulates a neural net N, it is not the case that S understands Chinese, therefore it is not the case that N understands Chinese. Copeland also notes results by Siegelmann and Sontag (1994) showing that some connectionist networks cannot be simulated by a universal Turing Machine (in particular, where connection weights are real numbers). There is another problem with the simulation-duplication distinction, arising from the process of evolution. Searle wishes to see original intentionality and genuine understanding as properties only of certain biological systems, presumably the product of evolution.

can select for the ability to use information about the environment creatively and intelligently, as long as this is manifest in the behavior of the organism. If there is no overt difference in behavior in any set of circumstances between a system that understands and one that does not, evolution cannot select for genuine understanding. And so it seems that on Searle s account, minds that genuinely understand meaning have no advantage over creatures that merely process information, using purely computational processes. Thus a position that implies that simulations of understanding can be just as biologically adaptive as the real thing, leaves us with a puzzle about how and why systems with genuine understanding could evolve.

As we have seen, since its appearance in 1980 the Chinese Room argument has sparked discussion across disciplines. Despite the extensive discussion there is still no consensus as to whether the argument is sound. At one end we have Julian Baggini s (2009) assessment that Searle came up with perhaps the most famous counter-example in history  the Chinese room argument  and in one intellectual punch inflicted so much damage on the then dominant theory of functionalism that many would argue it has never recovered. Whereas philosopher Daniel Dennett (2013, p. 320) concludes that the Chinese Room argument is clearly a fallacious and misleading argument .

goes on to claim that what distinguishes Watson is that it knows what it knows, and knows what it does not know. This appears to be claiming a form of reflexive self-awareness or consciousness for the Watson computer system. Thus the claims of strong AI now are hardly chastened, and if anything some are stronger and more exuberant. At the same time, as we have seen, many others believe that the Chinese Room Argument showed once and for all that at best computers can simulate human cognition.

Sarenput II was a rich and influential leader. He was an important Chief from Aswan, part of a ruling class of commanding and wealthy families. From an island on the Nile, they controlled the gateway to Africa and guarded important trade rules along the Nile into Egypt.

clues may be in how the mummies are prepared. Long before the Pharaohs of Egypt, mummies happened naturally when dead bodies dried up in the hot Egyptian desert. The early Egyptian priests then started to deliberately preserve the bodies of the dead pharaohs for the afterlife, by covering them with a mixture of salts and removing their brains, guts and other internal organs. Mummification grew in sophistication over centuries, as priests stuffed the nose with seeds and replaced the eyes with onions to make them even more lifelike.

But, not enough for it... NOZOMU: Yeah, yeah, we have crystals. SALIMA: To precipitate but, it wasn't very salted. NARRATOR: The lack of salt could mean this mummy is from the Coptic period, when their simple mummification process did not use as much salt.

In the lab of the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, an army of specialists are working around the clock to investigate and preserve Tutankhamun's treasures. All 5,398 are set to go on display, including a 3,300 year old chair, once used by the Boy King. It's down to Ahmed El Sheikha to restore it, ready for museum visitors. NARRATOR: But all Tutankhamun's treasures were almost lost forever. When Howard Carter discovered the tomb, 100 years ago, he found it had been broken into long before, but why did those first tomb raiders leave so much treasure behind  The robbers may have been the tomb builders themselves, breaking in soon after sealing the tomb."

These eyes are 'wedjat' eyes, meant to let the dead see outside the coffin and they normally match exactly the size of the body inside. The small size and shape of the eyes tells Alejandro who possibly occupied the tomb. ALEJANDRO: This is a coffin of a child. Very, very young, I would say, almost a baby.

the last tomb begun in the Valley of the Kings, and many times unfinished things in Egypt can actually tell you a little bit more than the completed product. NARRATOR: Ramses XI reigned over 1,000 years before Cleopatra, but when he died his tomb was never used. COLLEEN: So here you could see just the initial phases of the tomb decoration, but it's already a beautiful depiction of Ramses XI. We know exactly who we're looking at because of his cartouches, his name rings, in front of his face.

The tomb of Ramses XI is located in the east of the Valley of the Kings. Its cavernous chambers and pillared halls reveal how the pharaoh should have been buried, but the back of the tomb is unfinished. After 500 years of Egypt's kings and queens being buried in the Valley, Ramses' tomb marks the end of an era. Ramses XI abandoned the Valley of the Kings, and no more pharaohs were buried here.

The port city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great who conquered Egypt 2,300 years ago. It was famed for its palaces, statues, its library, and a colossal lighthouse standing over 350 feet tall, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. During this time, Egypt was ruled by the successors of Alexander, the Greek pharaohs called the Ptolemies, but this family line ended when the country was eventually conquered by Rome, leaving the last pharaoh of Egypt Queen Cleopatra. Many archaeologists think Cleopatra will be found in a royal cemetery somewhere in Alexandria, the capital built by her own family... but searching here is difficult.

So this is one of the exciting moments of an excavation. NARRATOR: For the past decade she has been building a case that Queen Cleopatra is buried beneath this temple. KATHLEEN: I want to be an archaeologist since I was a child, but my parents convinced me to study law, and I became a lawyer.

We have uncovered so many important structures that prove this temple functioned as a temple during the time of Queen Cleopatra and the Greek pharaohs. So this could be the perfect place for Cleopatra's lost tomb. NARRATOR: At the age of eighteen, Cleopatra became pharaoh when her father Ptolemy the twelfth died.

in 31 BC the Roman navy, led by Octavian, attacked Egypt. To avoid capture, legend has it that Cleopatra committed suicide with the bite of a venomous snake. KATHLEEN: She threatened Rome and Romans were afraid of her.

Kathleen believes Cleopatra could be buried somewhere around the site. This season, she has a promising lead 300 feet outside the temple walls; a strange hollow in the ground. KATHLEEN: We found a cut, it's a cut in the bedrock, it's a shaft, and we are trying to find out what, where it lead us.

has evidence the temple is linked to the Egyptian goddess Isis. Kathleen thinks this is her biggest clue so far. KATHLEEN: We have archaeological evidence that the temple was maybe the most important religious center for Isis in the north, and the thing we know about Queen Cleopatra is that she was buried in a temple of Isis. So it could be a perfect place for Cleopatra's lost tomb.

here that Dr. Colleen Darnell continues her own search for clues to Cleopatra's life, written in the hieroglyphs. COLLEEN: We're walking to the temple at Dendera, and one of the most significant scenes here is a depiction of Cleopatra. NARRATOR: The temple was first built 2,000-years ago and became a major place of worship for ordinary Egyptians.

was making a profound connection with one of the most popular goddesses of the time. Isis was famed for her powers of healing and protection and was adored by both Egyptians and Greeks. By immortalizing herself as Isis on the temple wall, Cleopatra hoped to keep the full support and love of her people, and it worked.

so exciting NARRATOR: Kathleen believes Cleopatra could be buried in an underground chamber, and the tunnels could lead her to it. She originally found the location of the shaft using radar technology, but with the potential for a huge discovery just feet away, she has brought in more sensitive military-grade equipment to look deeper into the rock. KATHLEEN: For me the future of the excavation is ground-penetrating radar. It's a technology that was used for military purposes, searching for tunnels and searching for cavities, and this technology is perfect for what I am looking for.

we are lucky to have non-invasive techniques, and the idea is that we are going to take to the university hospital in Aswan where they have very good CT scans. NARRATOR: By scanning the bodies, Alejandro hopes to examine how they died, and also to see if there are any funerary objects hidden inside.

a belief system that continued until Cleopatra's time. COLLEEN: Here deep in the tomb of Seti I we see a fantastic depiction of the goddess Wadjet, she's labelled here in the hieroglyphs and she is the cobra who sits on the brow of the king.

We are just checking if the scan was done right. NARRATOR: So far, very little is known about these mummies, like how they died, and whether they were old or young. Alejandro is trying to piece together their identities, hoping to discover any new clues to make sense of their lives, and ultimately, their deaths.

is ngrok Ngrok is a cross-platform application that creates secure tunnels (paths) to localhost machine. It enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server (like computer, laptop, rasbery PI) appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed.

downside to the free tier is the lack of custom domain support. How does ngrok work ngrok is able to bypass NAT Mapping and firewall restrictions by creating a long-lived TCP tunnel from a randomly generated subdomain on ngrok.com (e.g. 3gf892ks.ngrok.com) to the local machine. After specifying the port that your web server listens on, the ngrok client program initiates a secure connection to the ngrok server and then anyone can make requests to your local server with the unique ngrok tunnel address.

the ngrok server software can be self-hosted on a VPS or dedicated server. How to use ngrok By default, ngrok creates both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints, making it useful for testing integrations with third-party services or APIs that require valid SSL/TLS domains. Other use cases include: quickly showcasing local demos to clients, testing mobile application backends, and running personal cloud services from your home PC.

Ngrok secured Ngrok is a highly secure platform for remote access and is safe to use. Ngrok provides tunneling, as mentioned above, which enables users to access local-hosted servers from outside the machine. Ngrok security is based on encryption and control features, but its absolute level of security ultimately depends on how it is configured and used.

Control: Ngrok offers features to control access to tunnels, such as whitelisting IP addresses or requiring authentication tokens, which adds an extra layer of security. Tunnel Visibility: By default, Ngrok provides a randomly generated subdomain for each tunnel, which enhances security by making it harder for unauthorized users to discover and access the tunnel. Logging and Monitoring: Ngrok provides logging and monitoring features that allow users to track tunnel usage and detect any suspicious activity. However, it's essential to keep in mind that no system is entirely secure, and the security of Ngrok tunnels can be compromised if not configured correctly or if used improperly.

it's crucial to follow best practices for securing Ngrok tunnels, such as: Using strong authentication tokens. Restricting access to tunnels to only trusted users or IP addresses. Monitoring tunnel activity for any signs of unauthorized access.

hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising important questions for society, the economy, and governance. In this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U. S. and European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human values.2 In order to maximize AI benefits, we recommend nine steps for going forward: Encourage greater data access for researchers without compromising users personal privacy, invest more government funding in unclassified AI research, promote new models of digital education and AI workforce development so employees have the skills needed in the 21st-century economy, create a federal AI advisory committee to make policy recommendations, engage with state and local officials so they enact effective policies, regulate broad AI principles rather than specific algorithms, take bias complaints seriously so AI does not replicate historic injustice, unfairness, or discrimination in data or algorithms, maintain mechanisms for human oversight and control, and penalize malicious AI behavior and promote cybersecurity.       Back to top              Chapter I                   Qualities of artificial intelligence            Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.3 According to researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems make decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner."

Artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses. Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those data.

the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved experience is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.

includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.6 One of the reasons for the growing role of AI is the tremendous opportunities for economic development that it presents.

a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that AI-led automation can give the Chinese economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, depending on the speed of adoption.8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development. Finance Investments in financial AI in the United States tripled between 2013 and 2014 to a total of 12.2 billion.9 According to observers in that sector, Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check.10 In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers.11 These advances are designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices in a matter of minutes."

prominent example of this is taking place in stock exchanges, where high-frequency trading by machines has replaced much of human decisionmaking. People submit buy and sell orders, and computers match them in the blink of an eye without human intervention. Machines can spot trading inefficiencies or market differentials on a very small scale and execute trades that make money according to investor instructions.12 Powered in some places by advanced computing, these tools have much greater capacities for storing information because of their emphasis not on a zero or a one, but on quantum bits that can store multiple values in each location.13 That dramatically increases storage capacity and decreases processing times. Fraud detection represents another way AI is helpful in financial systems.

helps managers find problems early in the cycle, before they reach dangerous levels.14 National security AI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.15 According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is to meet our warfighters needs and to increase [the] speed and agility [of] technology development and procurement.16 Artificial intelligence will accelerate the traditional process of warfare so rapidly that a new term has been coined: hyperwar. The big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time if not eventually in real time thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unseen."

and control will similarly be affected as human commanders delegate certain routine, and in special circumstances, key decisions to AI platforms, reducing dramatically the time associated with the decision and subsequent action. In the end, warfare is a time competitive process, where the side able to decide the fastest and move most quickly to execution will generally prevail. Indeed, artificially intelligent intelligence systems, tied to AI-assisted command and control systems, can move decision support and decisionmaking to a speed vastly superior to the speeds of the traditional means of waging war. So fast will be this process, especially if coupled to automatic decisions to launch artificially intelligent autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal outcomes, that a new term has been coined specifically to embrace the speed at which war will be waged: hyperwar. While the ethical and legal debate is raging over whether America will ever wage war with artificially intelligent autonomous lethal systems, the Chinese and Russians are not nearly so mired in this debate, and we should anticipate our need to defend against these systems operating at hyperwar speeds."

challenge in the West of where to position humans in the loop in a hyperwar scenario will ultimately dictate the West s capacity to be competitive in this new form of conflict.17 Just as AI will profoundly affect the speed of warfare, the proliferation of zero day or zero second cyber threats as well as polymorphic malware will challenge even the most sophisticated signature-based cyber protection. This forces significant improvement to existing cyber defenses. Increasingly, vulnerable systems are migrating, and will need to shift to a layered approach to cybersecurity with cloud-based, cognitive AI platforms. This approach moves the community toward a thinking defensive capability that can defend networks through constant training on known threats.

is how certain key U. S.-based systems stopped the debilitating WannaCry and Petya viruses. Preparing for hyperwar and defending critical cyber networks must become a high priority because China, Russia, North Korea, and other countries are putting substantial resources into AI. In 2017, China s State Council issued a plan for the country to build a domestic industry worth almost 150 billion by 2030.18 As an example of the possibilities, the Chinese search firm Baidu has pioneered a facial recognition application that finds missing people. In addition, cities such as Shenzhen are providing up to 1 million to support AI labs.

example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.21 According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge 100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour.

deep learning can do in this situation is train computers on data sets to learn what a normal-looking versus an irregular-appearing lymph node is. After doing that through imaging exercises and honing the accuracy of the labeling, radiological imaging specialists can apply this knowledge to actual patients and determine the extent to which someone is at risk of cancerous lymph nodes. Since only a few are likely to test positive, it is a matter of identifying the unhealthy versus healthy node. AI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs 35 billion each year in the United States.

Criminal justice AI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven Strategic Subject List that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity.23 Judicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system.

machine-learning policy simulation concluded that such programs could be used to cut crime up to 24.8 percent with no change in jailing rates, or reduce jail populations by up to 42 percent with no increase in crime rates.24 However, critics worry that AI algorithms represent a secret system to punish citizens for crimes they haven t yet committed. The risk scores have been used numerous times to guide large-scale roundups.25 The fear is that such tools target people of color unfairly and have not helped Chicago reduce the murder wave that has plagued it in recent years. Despite these concerns, other countries are moving ahead with rapid deployment in this area.

New technologies make it possible to match images and voices with other types of information, and to use AI on these combined data sets to improve law enforcement and national security. Through its Sharp Eyes program, Chinese law enforcement is matching video images, social media activity, online purchases, travel records, and personal identity into a police cloud. This integrated database enables authorities to keep track of criminals, potential law-breakers, and terrorists.27 Put differently, China has become the world s leading AI-powered surveillance state.

investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector.28 Autonomous vehicles cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps.29 Light detection and ranging systems (LIDARs) and AI are key to navigation and collision avoidance. LIDAR systems combine light and radar instruments.

software enables cars to learn from the experiences of other vehicles on the road and adjust their guidance systems as weather, driving, or road conditions change. This means that software is the key not the physical car or truck itself. Since these cameras and sensors compile a huge amount of information and need to process it instantly to avoid the car in the next lane, autonomous vehicles require high-performance computing, advanced algorithms, and deep learning systems to adapt to new scenarios.

of the major ride-sharing companies are exploring driverless cars. The surge of car-sharing and taxi services such as Uber and Lyft in the United States, Daimler s Mytaxi and Hailo service in Great Britain, and Didi Chuxing in China demonstrate the opportunities of this transportation option. Uber recently signed an agreement to purchase 24,000 autonomous cars from Volvo for its ride-sharing service.32 However, the ride-sharing firm suffered a setback in March 2018 when one of its autonomous vehicles in Arizona hit and killed a pedestrian. Uber and several auto manufacturers immediately suspended testing and launched investigations into what went wrong and how the fatality could have occurred.33 Both industry and consumers want reassurance that the technology is safe and able to deliver on its stated promises.

cities Metropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery. For example, according to Kevin Desouza, Rashmi Krishnamurthy, and Gregory Dawson: The Cincinnati Fire Department is using data analytics to optimize medical emergency responses. The new analytics system recommends to the dispatcher an appropriate response to a medical emergency call whether a patient can be treated on-site or needs to be taken to the hospital by taking into account several factors, such as the type of call, location, weather, and similar calls.34 Since it fields 80,000 requests each year, Cincinnati officials are deploying this technology to prioritize responses and determine the best ways to handle emergencies. They see AI as a way to deal with large volumes of data and figure out efficient ways of responding to public requests.

is not alone. A number of metropolitan areas are adopting smart city applications that use AI to improve service delivery, environmental planning, resource management, energy utilization, and crime prevention, among other things. For its smart cities index, the magazine Fast Company ranked American locales and found Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, D. C., and New York City as the top adopters.

depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are accessible for exploration in the research community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.38 According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances. In this regard, the United States has a substantial advantage over China. Global ratings on data openness show that U. S. ranks eighth overall in the world, compared to 93 for China.39 But right now, the United States does not have a coherent national data strategy.

Racial issues also come up with facial recognition software. Most such systems operate by comparing a person s face to a range of faces in a large database. As pointed out by Joy Buolamwini of the Algorithmic Justice League, If your facial recognition data contains mostly Caucasian faces, that s what your program will learn to recognize.42 Unless the databases have access to diverse data, these programs perform poorly when attempting to recognize African-American or Asian-American features. Many historical data sets reflect traditional values, which may or may not represent the preferences wanted in a current system."

rules specify that people have the right to opt out of personally tailored ads and can contest legal or similarly significant decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention in the form of an explanation of how the algorithm generated a particular outcome. Each guideline is designed to ensure the protection of personal data and provide individuals with information on how the black box operates.47 Legal liability There are questions concerning the legal liability of AI systems. If there are harms or infractions (or fatalities in the case of driverless cars), the operators of the algorithm likely will fall under product liability rules. A body of case law has shown that the situation s facts and circumstances determine liability and influence the kind of penalties that are imposed.

state actively recruited Uber to test its autonomous vehicles and gave the company considerable latitude in terms of road testing. It remains to be seen if there will be lawsuits in this case and who is sued: the human backup driver, the state of Arizona, the Phoenix suburb where the accident took place, Uber, software developers, or the auto manufacturer. Given the multiple people and organizations involved in the road testing, there are many legal questions to be resolved. In non-transportation areas, digital platforms often have limited liability for what happens on their sites.

demanding that its users sacrifice basic rights, the company limits consumer protections and therefore curtails the ability of people to fight discrimination arising from unfair algorithms.49 But

Back to top              Chapter IV                   Recommendations            In order to balance innovation with basic human values, we propose a number of recommendations for moving forward with AI. This includes improving data access, increasing government investment in AI, promoting AI workforce development, creating a federal advisory committee, engaging with state and local officials to ensure they enact effective policies, regulating broad objectives as opposed to specific algorithms, taking bias seriously as an AI issue, maintaining mechanisms for human control and oversight, and penalizing malicious behavior and promoting cybersecurity.

all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. AI requires data to test and improve its learning capacity.50 Without structured and unstructured data sets, it will be nearly impossible to gain the full benefits of artificial intelligence. In general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data in the way Cambridge Analytica did with Facebook information.

for example, recently announced a partnership with Stanford economist Raj Chetty to use its social media data to explore inequality.51 As part of the arrangement, researchers were required to undergo background checks and could only access data from secured sites in order to protect user privacy and security. In the U. S., there are no uniform standards in terms of data access, data sharing, or data protection. Almost all the data are proprietary in nature and not shared very broadly with the research community, and this limits innovation and system design. Google long has made available search results in aggregated form for researchers and the general public.

makes much of its tweets available to researchers through application programming interfaces, commonly referred to as APIs. These tools help people outside the company build application software and make use of data from its social media platform. They can study patterns of social media communications and see how people are commenting on or reacting to current events. In some sectors where there is a discernible public benefit, governments can facilitate collaboration by building infrastructure that shares data.

enables researchers to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness, and make recommendations regarding the best medical approaches, without compromising the privacy of individual patients. There could be public-private data partnerships that combine government and business data sets to improve system performance. For example, cities could integrate information from ride-sharing services with its own material on social service locations, bus lines, mass transit, and highway congestion to improve transportation.

noted by Ian Buck, the vice president of NVIDIA, Data is the fuel that drives the AI engine. The federal government has access to vast sources of information. Opening access to that data will help us get insights that will transform the U. S. economy.53 Through its Data.gov portal, the federal government already has put over 230,000 data sets into the public domain, and this has propelled innovation and aided improvements in AI and data analytic technologies.54 The private sector also needs to facilitate research data access so that society can achieve the full benefits of artificial intelligence. Increase government investment in AI According to Greg Brockman, the co-founder of OpenAI, the U.

shortfall is noteworthy because the economic payoffs of AI are substantial. In order to boost economic development and social innovation, federal officials need to increase investment in artificial intelligence and data analytics. Higher investment is likely to pay for itself many times over in economic and social benefits.56 Promote digital education and workforce development As AI applications accelerate across many sectors, it is vital that we reimagine our educational institutions for a world where AI will be ubiquitous and students need a different kind of training than they currently receive.

are skills that are in short supply; unless our educational system generates more people with these capabilities, it will limit AI development. For these reasons, both state and federal governments have been investing in AI human capital. For example, in 2017, the National Science Foundation funded over 6,500 graduate students in computer-related fields and has launched several new initiatives designed to encourage data and computer science at all levels from pre-K to higher and continuing education.57 The goal is to build a larger pipeline of AI and data analytic personnel so that the United States can reap the full advantages of the knowledge revolution. But there also needs to be substantial changes in the process of learning itself.

will reconfigure how society and the economy operate, and there needs to be big picture thinking on what this will mean for ethics, governance, and societal impact. People will need the ability to think broadly about many questions and integrate knowledge from a number of different areas. One example of new ways to prepare students for a digital future is IBM s Teacher Advisor program, utilizing Watson s free online tools to help teachers bring the latest knowledge into the classroom.

Among the specific questions the committee is asked to address include the following: competitiveness, workforce impact, education, ethics training, data sharing, international cooperation, accountability, machine learning bias, rural impact, government efficiency, investment climate, job impact, bias, and consumer impact. The committee is directed to submit a report to Congress and the administration 540 days after enactment regarding any legislative or administrative action needed on AI. This legislation is a step in the right direction, although the field is moving so rapidly that we would recommend shortening the reporting timeline from 540 days to 180 days. Waiting nearly two years for a committee report will certainly result in missed opportunities and a lack of action on important issues.

with state and local officials States and localities also are taking action on AI. For example, the New York City Council unanimously passed a bill that directed the mayor to form a taskforce that would monitor the fairness and validity of algorithms used by municipal agencies.60 The city employs algorithms to determine if a lower bail will be assigned to an indigent defendant, where firehouses are established, student placement for public schools, assessing teacher performance, identifying Medicaid fraud and determine where crime will happen next.61 According to the legislation s developers, city officials want to know how these algorithms work and make sure there is sufficient AI transparency and accountability. In addition, there is concern regarding the fairness and biases of AI algorithms, so the taskforce has been directed to analyze these issues and make recommendations regarding future usage."

is scheduled to report back to the mayor on a range of AI policy, legal, and regulatory issues by late 2019. Some observers already are worrying that the taskforce won t go far enough in holding algorithms accountable. For example, Julia Powles of Cornell Tech and New York University argues that the bill originally required companies to make the AI source code available to the public for inspection, and that there be simulations of its decisionmaking using actual data. After criticism of those provisions, however, former Councilman James Vacca dropped the requirements in favor of a task force studying these issues.

broad objectives more than specific algorithms The European Union has taken a restrictive stance on these issues of data collection and analysis.63 It has rules limiting the ability of companies from collecting data on road conditions and mapping street views. Because many of these countries worry that people s personal information in unencrypted Wi-Fi networks are swept up in overall data collection, the EU has fined technology firms, demanded copies of data, and placed limits on the material collected.64 This has made it more difficult for technology companies operating there to develop the high-definition maps required for autonomous vehicles. The GDPR being implemented in Europe place severe restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In addition, these new rules give citizens the right to review how digital services made specific algorithmic choices affecting people. By taking a restrictive stance on issues of data collection and analysis, the European Union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the world. If interpreted stringently, these rules will make it difficult for European software designers (and American designers who work with European counterparts) to incorporate artificial intelligence and high-definition mapping in autonomous vehicles. Central to navigation in these cars and trucks is tracking location and movements.

this and other data protection actions, the European Union is putting its manufacturers and software designers at a significant disadvantage to the rest of the world. It makes more sense to think about the broad objectives desired in AI and enact policies that advance them, as opposed to governments trying to crack open the black boxes and see exactly how specific algorithms operate. Regulating individual algorithms will limit innovation and make it difficult for companies to make use of artificial intelligence. Take biases seriously Bias and discrimination are serious issues for AI.

Maintaining mechanisms for human oversight and control Some individuals have argued that there needs to be avenues for humans to exercise oversight and control of AI systems. For example, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence CEO Oren Etzioni argues there should be rules for regulating these systems. First, he says, AI must be governed by all the laws that already have been developed for human behavior, including regulations concerning cyberbullying, stock manipulation or terrorist threats, as well as entrap[ping] people into committing crimes.

His rationale is that these tools store so much data that people have to be cognizant of the privacy risks posed by AI. In the same vein, the IEEE Global Initiative has ethical guidelines for AI and autonomous systems. Its experts suggest that these models be programmed with consideration for widely accepted human norms and rules for behavior. AI algorithms need to take into effect the importance of these norms, how norm conflict can be resolved, and ways these systems can be transparent about norm resolution.

failures occur, there must be mitigation mechanisms to deal with the consequences. In particular, AI must be sensitive to problems such as bias, discrimination, and fairness.68 A group of machine learning experts claim it is possible to automate ethical decisionmaking. Using the trolley problem as a moral dilemma, they ask the following question: If an autonomous car goes out of control, should it be programmed to kill its own passengers or the pedestrians who are crossing the street They devised a voting-based system that asked 1.3 million people to assess alternative scenarios, summarized the overall choices, and applied the overall perspective of these individuals to a range of vehicular possibilities. That allowed them to automate ethical decisionmaking in AI algorithms, taking public preferences into account.69 This procedure, of course, does not reduce the tragedy involved in any kind of fatality, such as seen in the Uber case, but it provides a mechanism to help AI developers incorporate ethical considerations in their planning.

the manner in which AI systems unfold has major implications for society as a whole. It matters how policy issues are addressed, ethical conflicts are reconciled, legal realities are resolved, and how much transparency is required in AI and data analytic solutions.74 Human choices about software development affect the way in which decisions are made and the manner in which they are integrated into organizational routines. Exactly how these processes are executed need to be better understood because they will have substantial impact on the general public soon, and for the foreseeable future. AI may well be a revolution in human affairs, and become the single most influential human innovation in history.
